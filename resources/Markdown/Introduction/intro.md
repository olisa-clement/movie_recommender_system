**Problem Statement**

Build a movie recommendation web app based on content and collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting movies a user might like based on their preferences.

**Data Overview**

This dataset consists of several million 5-star ratings obtained from users of the online MovieLens movie recommendation service. The MovieLens dataset has long been used by industry and academic researchers to improve the performance of explicitly-based recommender systems. For this project, we used a special version of the MovieLens dataset which has enriched with additional data, and resampled for fair evaluation purposes.
